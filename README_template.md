# Parakeet: Music & Sound Effects for Bevy

## Overview

Welcome to **Parakeet**, an experimental crate designed to generate music and sound effects for the Bevy game engine. Currently in its alpha stage, Parakeet is aimed at providing tools to enhance audio experiences in Bevy projects. As the crate is not yet production-ready, it may undergo significant changes. We invite you to explore its features, provide feedback, and contribute to its development.

## Features

- **Procedural Music Generation**: Create dynamic, adaptive music using procedural algorithms.
- **Sound Effects Creation**: Generate a variety of sound effects for different in-game actions and events.
- **Audio Modulation**: Control pitch, volume, and other audio properties programmatically.

## Installation

To include Parakeet in your Bevy project, add the following to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
parakeet = "0.1.0"
```

Note that, as this crate is in alpha, future versions may introduce breaking changes.

## Usage

Hereâ€™s a basic example of how to integrate Parakeet with Bevy:

```rust
use bevy::prelude::*;
use parakeet::audio::{MusicGenerator, SoundEffect};

fn main() {
    App::build()
        .add_plugins((DefaultPlugins,))
        .add_startup_system(setup.system())
        .add_system(play_music.system())
        .add_system(play_sound_effect.system())
        .run();
}

fn setup(mut commands: Commands) {
    commands.spawn().insert(MusicGenerator::new());
    commands.spawn().insert(SoundEffect::new("explosion"));
}

fn play_music(mut query: Query<&mut MusicGenerator>) {
    for mut music in query.iter_mut() {
        music.play();
    }
}

fn play_sound_effect(mut query: Query<&mut SoundEffect>) {
    for mut sound in query.iter_mut() {
        sound.play();
    }
}
```
